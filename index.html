          Until 1991, the Internet was restricted to use only "... for research
          and education in the sciences and engineering ..."[1][2] and was used
          for email, telnet, FTP and USENET traffic—but only a tiny number of
          web pages. The World Wide Web protocols had only just been written[3]
          and not until the end of 1993 would there be a graphical web browser
          for Mac or Windows computers.[4] Even after there was some opening up
          of internet access, the situation was confused[clarification needed]
          until 1995.[5] To host a website on the internet, an individual or
          company would need their own computer or server.[6] As not all
          companies had the budget or expertise to do this, web hosting services
          began to offer to host users' websites on their own servers, without
          the client needing to own the necessary infrastructure required to
          operate the website. The owners of the websites, also called
          webmasters, would be able to create a website that would be hosted on
          the web hosting service's server and published to the web by the web
          hosting service. As the number of users on the World Wide Web grew,
          the pressure for companies, both large and small, to have an online
          presence grew. By 1995, companies such as GeoCities, Angelfire and
          Tripod were offering free hosting.[7] Classification Static page
          hosting The most basic is web page and small-scale file hosting, where
          files can be uploaded via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or a web
          interface. The files are usually delivered to the Web "as is" or with
          minimal processing. Many Internet service providers (ISPs) offer this
          service free to subscribers. Individuals and organizations may also
          obtain web page hosting from alternative service providers. Free web
          hosting service is offered by different companies with limited
          services, sometimes supported by advertisements,[needs update?] and
          often limited when compared to paid hosting. Single page hosting is
          generally sufficient for personal web pages. Personal website hosting
          is typically free, advertisement-sponsored, or inexpensive. Business
          website hosting often has a higher expense depending upon the size and
          type of the site. Until 1991, the Internet was restricted to use only "... for research
